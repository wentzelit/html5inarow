Tests to write
==============
- ~~Change all tests to assert.[test]~~
- Delete Token (TokenType is sufficient)

Game logic
------
- ~~there is a game object~~
- ~~there is a player object~~
- ~~A new game has two players~~
- ~~it's someones turn~~
- ~~A new game has a grid model~~

- ~~A new token is either of tokentype circle or cross~~
- ~~A new player has one of the token types~~
- ~~A new game has a cross token type~~
- ~~A new game has a circle token type~~
- ~~Make TokenTypes static~~

- The player in the game are in a dictionary

###Ending the game
- game ends when there are five tokens of the same kind in a row
- the player that has five tokens in a row wins the game

###Placing tokens
- ~~a token can be placed on an empty cell~~
- ~~a token can be added to grid model~~
- ~~a token can't be placed on another token~~
- ~~let rules be created with a gridModel~~
- ~~When it's player 1's turn player 2 cannot add a token~~
- ~~When it's player 1's turn player 1 can add a token~~
- ~~When a player has placed a token it's the other players turn~~


###Separate rule sets
- a token must be placed next to another token
- the first token in a game can be placed anywhere
